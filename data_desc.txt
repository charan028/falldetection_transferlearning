Data set size: There are 191 videos in total. There are flopping parts in the video, and there are frames in which there are no people in the video.
We acquired a total number of 191 video sequences including 143 containing falls and 48 containing severalnormal activities, motions, body transfers, for instance from a chair to a sofa. It was necessary to include morevideos containing falls than video without fall, since the average duration of a fall is only 14 frames, and sincethe decision of the classiﬁer is made at the frame level. In these sequences, nine diﬀerent characters are acting,nevertheless only one at a time is present in the video. The frame rate is 25 frames/s and the original resolution(640x480) is downsampled to 320x240 pixels for the next experiments.
